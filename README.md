# CreditRisk
Kaggle Competition by Home Credit Group.

This was my capstone project for my MS in Predictive Analytics at Northwestern.  
There is a video presentation that my group did for this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgQkg1Zidk 
NOTE: this presentation is nearly an hour long - consider yourself fore-warned...

We took the role of consultants taking on this project & this was to be our big presentation to the client.
Our instructor loved it - he actually put us in to the 'Hall of Fame' of presentations, showing this to future students as an example of A-level work.
